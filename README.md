# Othurworld
Welcome to Othurworld, the RPG game that stretches across "parallel" dimensions!
Development may take a while, but we hope to have a demo by around 2018 or so.
## Download
Sorry, but the demo is not complete yet.
To download Othurworld when it comes out, go [here](https://ufuueueuru.github.io/Othurworld/).
Please keep in mind that currently the demo is not out.
### If you really want to play it right now
You can do very little to nothing in the game right now, but if you want to you can download the source code from this repository onto eclipse and run it.
This method is not suggested because (once again) there is very little to do in the game right now.
## Note
This game is being developed in eclipse neon because some of our computers are not new enough to run newer versions of eclipse. If this changes any functionality, please contact us.
The save file for the game (save.savo) is not going to work for newer versions. This means that anything that you do right now will not be transferable.
