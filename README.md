# Othurworld
Welcome to Othurworld, the RPG game that stretches across "parallel" dimensions!
Development may take a while, but we hope to have a demo by around 202~ or so.
## Download
Sorry, but the demo is not complete yet.
To download Othurworld when it comes out, go [here](https://ufuueueuru.github.io/Othurworld/).
Please keep in mind that currently the demo is not out.
### If you really want to play it RIGHT NOW!
You can do very-little-to-nothing in the game right now, but, if you want to, you can download the source code, from this repository onto Eclipse, and run it.
This method is not suggested because, (once again) there is very little to do in the game right now.
## Note
This game is being developed in an older Eclipse version because of our computers' ability to run Eclipse. If this changes any part of the game's functionality, please contact us. 
The save file for the game (save.savo) will not work for newer versions. This means that anything that you do (in game) as of right now will not be transferable to further versions.
